Can change the initial input by changing the testFlavor in MuddyNet.changePattern;

Some of the neurons have both inhibitory and excitatory synapses.

This doesn't take advantage of temporal variables.  So all three already 
know q.

Could set it up so the ground truth (e.g. p1 and p2 are dirty) could set
off the appropriate variables (e.g. K1p2 K2p1 K3p1p2).
