Copy the car files
Change the learning so that at S > Sb we decorrelate.
  This will require keeping track of the last x (we'll try 10) firings on
    synapses.
    
    Ok, I played with this and it looks like I've got a good problem, and some
    advancement.  The problem is that the system can store 10 sets of cars
    more or less perfectly.  Increasing this to 20 leads to lots of errors.
    These 20 add several that have four overlapping input features (of 6).
    
    The post-compensatory rule works relatively badly on this.  There's a slight
    improvement if the anti mechanism is used.  As it now records the last 10 firings,
    this anti-rule records reduces the strength of the uncofiring ones and the
    those that don't cofire much, while increasing the ones that do.  I think
    this opens up some space in the synaptic strength (because post-compensatory
    is still running) so that some fractionation happens.  
    
    Some things change it.  How much to reduce or increase, gas size,
    steps recorded, SB, but we always seem to get quite a few errors in
    any runs of 20.    
    
    One way forward may be by trying to make all of the units have connections
    that can be inhibitory or excitatory.  We could then relatively easily set
    the amount of energy in the system.
