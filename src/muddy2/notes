This involves the temporal variables.

We add a timing net.  As the rules pop off on cycle 22, completing their work on cycle
23, the timing net will have 50 cycles.  Unlike the existing rules (from MuddyCANT23),
supported temporal rules will ignite on the 49th cycle with the effect from the 50th.

I think it works now.  To test it on different configurations, MuddyNet.changePattern
has to be modified.  Modify testFlavor.  The comments say which is which.
