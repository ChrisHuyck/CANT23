I developed this in eclipse, but was recently just doing it from the dos prompt.

All the java files are included, and the .xml file.  No other files are needed.

Compile it and run.  Output should come out to the dos window (eclipse console).

It's set to run the standard 800 gas simulation.  

If you want to change the size of the gas, change the rows or columns in xor3.xml.

If you want to change so that it learns during testing (or spontaneous firing), 
change learnWhileTesting in Xor3CANT.java.  

If you want to have some spontaneous activation between training and testing, change
the spontaneousOnlyCycles in Xor3CANT.java.  (Both this and learning during testing
can be changed by changing the initial value at the top of the file.)

You'll want to compile and run after the two variable changes, and I expect after the
xml change.
