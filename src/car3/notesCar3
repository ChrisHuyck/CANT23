This is a combination of the IO from car2 (auto), and the learning mechanisms from
som2.  

So, let's start with an input net (neurons), som net (spont fatigue neurons), and
an output net (spont fatigue neurons).  There is no internal support in input, 
som (from som2) has 10.  From som2 input is connected to som with each neuron having
20 random connections.  

The question is what to do with output, including its
internal support, and connections to and from som.  Let's start with 20% inhibitory
neurons and 10 internal connections.
