Every time I make a new CANT (e.g. MuddyCANT23) in eclipse, I have a CANT23 cannot be 
resolved error.   This is fixed by adding the new folder to the Java Build path.  Then
put the file in the default package (by clicking on the compiler error in the first 
line of the file). Might also want to try
properties run/debug settings and redoing the file that you've started, and refreshing.

create the directory
project properties build path add directory
file new class
